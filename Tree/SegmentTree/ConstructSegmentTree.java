    // A segment tree is a data structure used to store information about array segments and answer segment queries efficiently.

    // There are two main operations performed on a segment tree:
    // 1. range(i, j): gives the sum of the array elements starting at index i and ending at index j.
    // 2. update(i, val): updates the value at index i to the val in the original array and updates the segment tree accordingly.

    // Both range(i, j) and update(i, val) take log(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the segment tree.
