# Decorator Pattern

- It is used to modify the functionality of an object at runtime. At the same time other instances of the same class will not be affected by this, so individual object gets the modified behavior.
- It uses abstract classes or interface with composition to implement.


- We use inheritance or composition to extend the behavior of an object but this is done at compile time, and it's applicable to all the instances of the class. We can’t add any new functionality of remove any existing behavior at runtime – this is when Decorator pattern comes into picture.
