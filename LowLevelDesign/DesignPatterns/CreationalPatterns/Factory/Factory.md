# Factory Pattern

- When there is Superclass and Multiple Subclasses and we want to get object of Subclasses based on input and requirement.
- Then we create factory class which takes the responsibility of creating object of class based on input.

### Advantages of Factory Design Pattern
1. Focus on creating object for interface rather than implementation.
2. Loose coupling, more robust code.
