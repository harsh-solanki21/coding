# Prototype Pattern 

- Prototype pattern is used when Object creation is a costly affair and requires a lot of time and resources, and you have a similar object already existing.

- So this pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new object and then modify it according to our needs.


- The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch, because creating a new object may be costly.

- This approach saves costly resources and time, especially when object is a heavy process.

> Whether to use shallow or deep copy of the Object properties depends on the requirements, and itâ€™s a design decision.
