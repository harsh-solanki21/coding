# Open/Closed Principle

- **Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.**


- Changing the current behaviour of a Class will affect all the systems using that Class.
- If you want the Class to perform more functions, the ideal approach is to add to the functions that already exist NOT change them.
