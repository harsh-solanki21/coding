=> Scalable code:
- Scalability can be judged on how many lines of code you need to modify to implement the new requirement code.

=> Robust code:
- A code that can handle or process all the possible inputs without failing or generating error.
- Code that doesn't break: Means when you are writing a function that takes parameters. Your code never breaks whatever parameters are given.
For example an integer multiplication function should even work (give guidance) when strings or floats or arrays are given as inputs.

=> Modular code:
- Code that is logically broken up into functions and modules.

=> Maintainable code:
- Your code is easy to read, understand, modify, and reuse by yourself and others.
